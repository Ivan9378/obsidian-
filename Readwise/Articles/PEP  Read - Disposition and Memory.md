## Highlights
- the theory of dispositions. I shall first sketch, as a necessary background, a very over-simplified scheme of dispositions in the conscious mind, and then try to complicate it. It is foolishness, and destructive foolishness, to insist on absolute and final clarity in the interpretation of any part of a new and developing science. But there is a place for first approximations.
- One may argue that, for every distinct state of mind and inner feeling, there must exist a distinct expression of this state in a perceptible pattern or behaviour; for it seems that the perceptible patterns of behaviour must be the original endowment from which the purely mental states or activities developed, as a kind of shadow of the original, or as a residue from it. Various metaphors might be suggested here, but I think this metaphor of the 'shadow' is peculiarly appropriate to the relation of inner feeling to behaviour. When I speak of 'original endowment' and of 'development', I might be taken to be speaking of the natural process of evolution, the evolution of the human species from the other animals, or, alternatively, of the development of man in history. This is not my meaning. I am referring to the development of any single individual of the species, from infancy onwards.
